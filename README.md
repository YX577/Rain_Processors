# SateRain_Processors
This repository contains Matlab codes I made to process different satellite precipitation products. Currently, this includes:
 1)TMPA 3B42 V7, real-time and gauge-adjusted version (TRT_Process.m and TV7_Process.m);
 2)High resolution CMORPH, real-time and gauge-adjusted version (HRC_Process.m);
 3)PERSIANN-CCS (CCS_Process.m).
