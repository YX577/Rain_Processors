# Rain_Processors
This repository contains Matlab codes I made to process different satellite precipitation products. Currently, this includes:
 1)Real-time TMPA-3B42 (TRT_Process.m);
 2)Gauge-adjusted TMPA-3B42 (TV7_Process.m);
 3)Real-time and gauge-adjusted high resolution CMORPH (HRC_Process.m);
 4)Real-time and gauge-adjusted PERSIANN (PER_Process.m);
 5)PERSIANN-CCS (CCS_Process.m);
 6)GSMaP-MVK and GSMaP-gauge (GSM_Process.m); and
 7)CHIRP and CHIRPS (CHP_Process.m).
